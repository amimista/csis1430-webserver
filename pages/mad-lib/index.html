            Every once in a while, a revolutionary <span><input type="text" placeholder="Noun" id="noun-1"></span> comes along that
            changes everything and Apple has been - well, first of all, one's very
            <span><input type="text" placeholder="Adjective" id="adjective-1" onchange="changeLink('adjective-1')"></span> if you get to work on just one of these in your career.
            Apple has been very <span><input type="text" placeholder="Adjective" id="adjective-1-link" disabled></span>. It's been able to introduce a few of
            these into the <span><input type="text" placeholder="Noun" id="noun-2"></span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, before we get into it, let me talk about a category of things. The
            most advanced <span><input type="text" placeholder="Noun" id="noun-3" onchange="changeLink('noun-3')"></span> are called smart <span><input type="text" placeholder="Noun" id="noun-3-link" disabled></span>, so they say. And they typically combine a <span><input type="text" placeholder="Noun" id="noun-3-link2" disabled></span> plus some e-mail capability, plus they <span><input type="text" placeholder="Verb" id="verb-1"></span>
            it's the Internet. It's sort of the baby Internet into one device, and
            they all have these <span><input type="text" placeholder="Adjective" id="adjective-2"></span> plastic keyboards on them. And the problem
            is that they're not so smart and they're not so easy to <span><input type="text" placeholder="Verb" id="verb-2"></span>, and so if
            you kind of make a Business School 101 graph of the smart axis and the
            easy-to-use axis, phones, regular cell phones are right there, they're
            not so smart, and they're not so easy to use.

            Today I went to the zoo. I saw a(n) <span><input type="text" placeholder="Adjective" id="adjective-1"></span> <span><input type="text" placeholder="Noun" id="noun-1"></span> jumping up and down in it's tree. He
            <span><input type="text" placeholder="Verb(past)" id="verb-1"></span> <span><input type="text" placeholder="Adverb" id="adverb-1"></span> through the large tunnel that led to its <span><input type="text" placeholder="Adjective" id="adjective-2"></span> <span><input type="text" placeholder="Noun" id="noun-2"></span>. I got some peanuts and passed
            them through the cage to a gigantic gray <span><input type="text" placeholder="Noun" id="noun-3"></span> towering above my head. Feeding that animal made me hungry. I went to get a <span><input type="text" placeholder="Adjective" id="adjective-3"></span> scoop of ice cream. It filled my stomach. Afterwards I had to <span><input type="text" placeholder="Verb(past)" id="verb-2"></span> <span><input type="text" placeholder="Adverb" id="adverb-2"></span> to catch our bus. When I got home I <span><input type="text" placeholder="Verb(past)" id="verb-1"></span> my Mom for a <span><input type="text" placeholder="Adjective" id="adjective-4"></span> day at the zoo.
